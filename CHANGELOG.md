## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `message`: the length-prefixed gRPC frame. `parseHeader` and `write` handle
  one message, and `Iterator` walks complete messages out of one buffer under a
  receive limit.
- `status`: the seventeen gRPC codes, `parse` and `codeFromInt` for the decimal
  wire form, and `decode` for the percent-escaped `grpc-message` field.
- `timeout`: `parse` and `encode` for the `grpc-timeout` field.
